### FAQ
**Q:** What's the point of an afk fish farming? <br>
**A:** You can sell the fishes for in-game credits. It's a reliable way to farm lots of credits while you do something else productive instead.

**Q:** Does this bot have a 100% catch rate? <br>
**A:** No. This program cannot handle combos above 100 (generally speaking on my pc at least). But failing to make a catch does not break the program (it'll simply continue fishing from combo 1).

**Q:** Instead of changing the in-game key-binds, can I set the program to use my own keys instead? <br>
**A:** For now no. Trying to change the key binds in the python script to WASD (or other variants) causes the game to not register the inputs. I might fix it in the future, sorry for the inconvenience.
